the truth
a lie
an extraterrestrial
the existence of extraterrestrial life
the greatest of lies
my belief
my faith
my singular quest for the truth
my faith in the truth
life on this planet
a vast government conspiracy
this coverup
someone who reveals the truth
Agent Scully
my whole life
skepticism
the source of my beliefs
all that they have to hide
a force beyond our comprehension
our darkest secret
our deepest national shame
an ongoing government charade
the plot to conceal the truth
a global conspiracy
an experience I cannot explain
this unexplained phenomenon
the life I have lived
the abduction of my sister
alien intelligence
the plot to create an alien-human hybrid
the continued existence of the human race
an unknown virus
a sinister government operative
looking to the heavens
the scale of this deception
my dream
my last hope
my personal obsession
ancient references to alien life
a sighting of nine unidentified craft
the historic crash at Roswell and its legendary coverup
the pentagon
a group of multiple independent witnesses
a secret study on extraterrestrial materials and bodies
the UFO phenomenon
an official government memorandum
the one question that all of us must ask ourselves
a new threat appearing in the skies over America
a spaceship using electro-gravitic propulsion
an alien craft drawn to earth through wormholes by the H-bomb
an advanced extraterrestrial species
aliens' concern for mankind and the threat of our self-destruction
a secret memo directing scientific study of alien technology and biochemistry
a classified study done at military installations
a testing program of unsuspecting human subjects
an elaborately staged abduction
forced implantation of alien embryos
an alien civilization
a major UFO hotspot
