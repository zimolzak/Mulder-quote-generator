the truth
a man in power
a lie
an extraterrestrial
the existence of extraterrestrial life
the greatest of lies
my belief
my faith
my singular quest for the truth
my faith in the truth
life on this planet
a vast government conspiracy
this coverup
someone who reveals the truth
Agent Scully
my whole life
skepticism
the source of my beliefs
all that they have to hide
a force beyond our comprehension
our darkest secret
our deepest national shame
an ongoing government charade
the plot to conceal the truth
a global conspiracy
an experience I cannot explain
this unexplained phenomenon
the life I have lived
the abduction of my sister
alien intelligence
the plot to create an alien-human hybrid
the continued existence of the human race
an unknown virus
a sinister government operative
looking to the heavens
the scale of this deception
my dream
my last hope
