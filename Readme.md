Mulder Monologue Generator
========================

Make sentences that sound like Mulder droning on and on during an
episode of the TV show The X-Files . Sentences are grammatical but
silly: only slightly more silly than Mulder's way of speaking.

Example of one of the more comprehensible quotes generated: "My belief
is revealed to be a lie, even though the existence of extraterrestrial
life has become the truth."
