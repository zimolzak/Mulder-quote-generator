Mulder Monologue Generator
========================

Makes sentences that sound like Mulder droning on and on during an
episode of the TV show _The X-Files._ This code will generate
sentences that are grammatical but silly: only slightly more silly
than Mulder's way of speaking. Currently can produce more than 3.3E+16
unique sentences!

Usage:

    ./mulder.pl
    ./mulder.pl --count

Example of one of the more comprehensible quotes generated: "My belief
is revealed to be a lie, even though the existence of extraterrestrial
life has become the truth."
