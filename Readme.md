Mulder Monologue Generator
========================

Makes sentences that sound like Mulder droning on and on during an
episode of the TV show _The X-Files._ This code will generate
sentences that are grammatical but silly: only slightly more silly
than Mulder's way of speaking. The original model that I (not the
algorithm) came up with is, "I have been with a faith. But that faith
was a lie, but even so, is the lie really more believable than my
faith in that very lie? Or is it even the truth?" Currently can
produce more than 5.0E+17 unique sentences!

Now with Twitter API hook-up.

Usage:

    ./mulder.py
    ./mulder.py --count
    ./mulder.py --twitter
    python bot.py

Example of one of the more comprehensible quotes generated: "My belief
is revealed to be a lie, even though the existence of extraterrestrial
life has become the truth."

See `out.txt` in this repository for several more examples.
